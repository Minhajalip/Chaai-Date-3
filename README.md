Project Description

This is a fun, interactive webpage where you invite your special friend (🌝❤️) for a "chaai date" in Malayalam. They can click “Pova” (Let’s go) or try to click “Aloikatte” (No thanks) — but the "No" button cheekily runs away when hovered over! If they finally agree, they get a cute animation as a reward.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Too many people take life too seriously. Also, saying "No" to chai is a crime that must be prevented at all costs.


---

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A website that makes it almost impossible to say "No" to chai — because the "No" button literally refuses to be clicked. Problem solved. Chai saved. Humanity restored.
